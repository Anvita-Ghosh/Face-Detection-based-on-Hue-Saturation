# Face-Detection-based-on-Hue-Saturation
Face detection and clustering using OpenCV and K-Means. This project extracts HSV features from detected faces, performs unsupervised clustering, and classifies a template image into the learned clusters. Includes visualisations, distance-based analysis, and practical implementation of feature-based image grouping.
